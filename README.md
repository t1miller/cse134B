We have revised some of our pages to give the user a better experience.

*no more session_tracker.html
session_tracker.html will now be implemented in index.html. When the user wants to edit a hero, a dynamic form will be created in JS. This lets the user add a session without ever leaving the home page. Much better UX.

*users can now add new heroes to the hero list. This list used to be a static list of around 21 heroes. This will enable the user to focus more on the specific heroes they play. This is a more common scenario for how the Overtwatch game is played. 

*no more non_login_index
We decided that if the user is not logged in they will see a generic hero list instead of loading their custom hero list.
